# Week 4 TA Meeting - (1/29/2020, 3:30 PM PST)

Attendees: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Sasya Reddi

Agenda:
Updated Sasya on our current status as a team. We told her that our group has experienced no issues so far with respect to attendance, conflicts, and fair contribution on the part of each team member. Dillan inquired about needed features for the app and Sasya responded by telling us that there is a lot of flexibility allowed and that we should group features into different categories of “importance” (sort of like a priority list). Minimalist and complex approaches to app development are both welcome. Sasya suggested that in either case, we should still focus on the most important features before anything else. Sasya also requested that we ask the rest of our group what can be done to make future discussion sections more useful.
