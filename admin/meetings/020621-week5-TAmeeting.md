# Week 5 TA Meeting - (2/06/2021, 2:30 PM PST)

Attendees: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Sasya Reddi

Agenda:
Sasya was informed about how our most recent group meeting went. We asked her how long the statement of purpose should be and she said 3-5 sentences. She also advised us to consider hosting stand-up meetings in order to allow for consistent updates on a more regular basis. Stand ups should motivate people to finish things before the meeting starts. If asynchronous methods work better for us, thatâ€™s fine too. Slack functionality to accommodate stand-up meetings was also discussed. Sasya suggested focusing on the task-timer selection from a user-end perspective to come to a decision, as well as focusing on the pros/cons of our options. Bottom line, we need to be able to justify why we used a certain method.
