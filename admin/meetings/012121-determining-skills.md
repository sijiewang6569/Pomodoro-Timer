# Week 3 Group Meeting - (1/21/2020, 4:00 PM PST)

Attendees: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag

Agenda:
Discussed features to be implemented for the Pomodoro project. Team is currently considering the necessary components for the timer, including a start button, 25 minute and 5 minute timers for work/rest, and an option to adjust the timer from a range of 15 minutes - 30 minutes.
For the Pomodoro To-Do List, the team was largely confused by the requirements, especially with respect to the portions that suggested that a meta-analysis of data was required. Features discussed included storage of the date and name, a place to input task names, a place to input Pomodoro estimations, and a counter to estimate the actual amount of Pomodoros utilized.
Team roles were discussed but no final decisions were made. A spreadsheet was created (named Members Technical Skills) where each team member filled in their skills, confidence in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and experience in making web applications. This should help in the future when team role assignments are discussed again.


Required Tasks:
N/A

Optional Tasks:
Each group member should fill out the Members Technical Skills spreadsheet with their preferred roles if they are able to come to a final decision
