# Brainstorm Activity / Week 4 Group Meeting - (1/28/2020, 4:00 PM PST)

Attendees: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag, Sijie Wang

Agenda:
Team conducted a brainstorming session through Miro in order to complete the Brainstorming Activity assignment. Instead of doing this asynchronously, we decided to use our normal group meeting time to get everyone together and complete the assignment in one sitting. Topics discussed concerning Pomodoro app design included but were not limited to: appropriate colors, specific timer parameters, essential features, general design philosophy, and how the app would respond to different sequences of user actions. A flowchart was created to map out how exactly the app would respond to different types of user inputs based on their order of execution. 

Ambiguous segments of the app design were also discussed and explicitly mentioned in our brainstorm submission in order to maintain a record of unanswered questions. Refer to the "optional tasks" section below to find out what these partially discussed topics were. 

Brainstorm document/diagram was successfully completed during our group meeting and pushed to github.

Required Tasks:
N/A

Optional Tasks:

- Think about whether the user should be allowed to exit the app if they have tasks leftover.
- Consider whether restarting of the timer once Pomodoro session is killed should be automatic or not.
