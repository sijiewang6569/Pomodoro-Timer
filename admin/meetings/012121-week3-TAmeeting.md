# Week 3 TA Meeting - (1/21/2020, 6:00 PM PST)

Attendees: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Sasya Reddi

Agenda:
Managers asked Sasya about whether more details regarding the project would be brought up soon. She mentioned that an upcoming assignment with relevant information is soon to be released, which should help provide us with some direction going forward. Managers also told Sasya about how every assignment was submitted in a timely manner by the team, but assigning specific team roles during our latest group meeting has been difficult since it is still hard for us to understand the work that each role entails. Sasya suggested using miro.com for future group meetings in order to improve the efficiency of brainstorming sessions and said that itâ€™s fine that we have not made a decision on team roles yet. Finally, we all concluded that future TA/manager meetings should be open to everyone else on the team if they wish to join.
