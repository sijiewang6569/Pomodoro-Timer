### 2. **Primary Means of Communication and Expectations**
We will communicate through Slack to organize meetings, update our team members, and converse about other topics. Each member is expected to be active on Slack and have notifications on. Each member must also be courteous and respectful to others while sending messages on Slack.

We will use Zoom for synchronous meetings as well.

### 3. **Scheduling Meetings** 
We agree to meet with the entire team every Thursday at 4 PM PST. If a team member cannot make it to the meeting, they must notify the rest of the team at least 24 hours beforehand. Additional meetings will be scheduled as required. We all agree that we can only miss at most one meeting. 

### 4. **General Responsibilities for All Team Members**
All team members will be kind and respectful to each other, taking into account the consequences of their actions and words. Team members will attend all meetings. If a team member must miss a meeting, they will catch up on what was covered during the meeting. Each team member can miss at most one meeting. Team members will also complete their assigned tasks on time to maintain the progress of the team as a whole.

### 5. **Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines**
To be determined with more project details.

### 6. **Conflict Resolution**
If a conflict arises, we will do our best to resolve it among ourselves first. The best way to resolve conflicts would be to schedule a short meeting to discuss the issue and reach out to the team leads for guidance. We will be open, honest, and humble with each other to promote the productivity of the entire team. If the conflict persists after the meeting, we will contact our group TA to resolve the issue.

### 7. **Expectations of Faculty and TA’s**
Reasonable accommodations from the faculty and TA’s in response to extraordinary situations that make deadlines difficult to meet are expected. For example, if a team member is sick/injured and unable to communicate with us during the emergency, a deadline extension would be warranted.
