# Where to Keep the Start Button

* Deciders: Sharon Lei, Dillan Merchant, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi
* Date: February 7th, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

There are two possible locations for where we can keep the button to start the timer. Which one would be most ideal?

## Considered Options

* Right below the actual timer
* Next to each task

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Right below the actual timer 

* Good, because it allows for one central place to start the timer, with minimal distractions
* Bad, because it may involve more clicks to actually start the timer

### Option 2: Next to each task

* Good, because it takes at most one click to start the timer relative to a specific task
* Bad, because it may make the website more cluttered and messy

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 (below the timer), because most timers tend to have their start button very close to the actual timer and having a central place to start the timer promotes simplicity.
