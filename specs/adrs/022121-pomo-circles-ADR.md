* Deciders: Dillan Merchant, Baban Hamesalh, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Sijie Wang
* Date: February 21st, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Up until now, there has been no consideration for whether or not the user should be able to see how many pomodoros are left until they receive a long break. Should this be left as is or dealt with?

## Considered Options

* Do not allow the user to see how many pomodoros are left
* Implement an indicator on the site (with circles) that show how many pomodoros need to be completed before a long break

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Do not let user see number of pomodoros left

* Good, because it increases the minimalism of the site
* Bad, because it allows for more empty space on the site
* Bad, because the user is left in the dark about a key component of the pomodoro timer

### Option 2: Implement indicator

* Good, because it allows the user to know how much time is left until they get a long break
* Good, because it removes a large chunk of empty space on the site
* Bad, because it may appear as a distractor on the site to the average user

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 2 (Implement Indicator), because it is beneficial to remove empty space on the site while also providing the user with some vital information about how they're working.
