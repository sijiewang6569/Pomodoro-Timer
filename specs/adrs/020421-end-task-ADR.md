# Ending a Task after Completion

* Deciders: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag, Sijie Wang
* Date: February 4th, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

What should the user be allowed to do in the situation where they finish a task with time left over on the pomodoro timer?

## Considered Options

* User should be allowed to kill the pomodoro and start the next task on a different pomodoro
* User should wait and review the task they completed while waiting for the timer to end

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Kill the pomodoro

* Good, because it gives users the ability to not waste time if they deem it as such
* Bad, because there's nothing to differentiate a pomodoro that was killed for distractions versus completion

### Option 2: Wait and review

* Good, because it follows the general sentiment found online on how to approach this question
* Good, because users will be able to stick to limits of the timers they set for themselves, even if it means checking over completed work
* Bad, because tasks completed at the start of a timer will leave the user with large amounts of time to check over work

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 2 (Wait and review), because when creating a pomodoro timer, it makes sense to follow the generalized rules behind all pomodoro timers before taking personal consideration into effect.
