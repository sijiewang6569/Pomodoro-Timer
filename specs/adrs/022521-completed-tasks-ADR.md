# Should there be an extra list of tasks that have been completed?

* Deciders: Dillan Merchant, Baban Hamesalh, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Sijie Wang
* Date: February 25th, 2021 

## Context and Problem Statement

When a task is completed, where should it go? Should it disappear or be present for the user to see?

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Keep the task on the same list but crossed off
* Option 2: Move the task to a separate list that exists solely to hold completed tasks

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Task Crossed Off

* Good, because it increases the minimalistic aspects of the site by having fewer buttons
* Bad, the list may be more cluttered

### Option 2: Move task to new list

* Good, because user will be able to track all of the tasks they've completed in a separate list
* Bad, because it decreases the minimalistic aspects of the site

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 (Task Crossed Off), because having an extra button to switch over to a different lists acts against minimalism and also is a distractor.
