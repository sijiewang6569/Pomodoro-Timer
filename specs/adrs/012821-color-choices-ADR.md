# Color Choices for Website

* Deciders: Baban Hamesalh, Dillan Merchant, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag, Sijie Wang <!-- optional -->
* Date: January 28th, 2021 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

When creating our website, we have to decide upon the best colors that will overarch specific sections of it. Which colors would be the best?

## Considered Options

* Work Timer: Red, Short Break: Light Green, Long Break: Dark Green
* Work Timer: Blue, Short Break: Light Green, Long Break: Orange

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Option 1: Work Timer: Red, Short Break: Light Green, Long Break: Dark Green

* Good, because red reflects the color of a tomato, bringing it closer to the idea of a pomodoro timer
* Good, because break colors are similar
* Bad, because some of the colors used don't promote the ideas related to what they are representing

### Option 2: Work Timer: Blue, Short Break: Light Green, Long Break: Orange

* Good, because all of the colors promote proper ideas, whether it be focusing with blue or relaxing with orange
* Good, because color choices offset us from the standard time and make us more unique
* Bad, because break colors are different

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 2 (Work Timer: Blue, Short Break: Light Green, Long Break: Orange), because the benefits provided for this option allow us to create a timer that is more oriented towards the user and doesn't necessarily pull from traditional ideas.
