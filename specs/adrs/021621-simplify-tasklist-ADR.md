# Should the Task List be Simplified?

* Deciders: Sharon Lei, Dillan Merchant, Sean Ye
* Date: February 16th, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

The appearance of the task list that is present in the wireframe that was submitted for the project pitch now appears to be cluttered. Should it be simplified?

## Considered Options

* Simplify the task list appearance
* Leave the task list as is

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Simplify

* Good, because the newer design will align more with the minimalistic aspects of the rest of the application
* Bad, because it may require backtracking on progress that has been made

### Option 2: Leave as is

* Good, because it would involve less work to implement overall
* Bad, because the final product will appear very cluttered and unappealing to the average user

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 (Simplify), because it is far more important to have uniformly equal application, even if it will require backtracking and reassessing certain parts of progress that have already been made.
