# Presence of No Button on Break Session

* Deciders: Dillan Merchant, Baban Hamesalh, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag, Sijie Wang
* Date: February 25th, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, users have the ability to click Yes during a break when they have finished a task. Should there also be a No button?

## Considered Options

* There should be a No Button
* There should not be a No Button

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Add No Button

* Good, because it is beneficial for the user to have an alternate button to click rather than having to stare at the Yes button
* Bad, because it detracts from minimalism

### Option 2: Do not add No Button

* Good, because it doesn't negatively impact minimalism
* Bad, because it makes the user have to stare at a Yes button that will not be clicked

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 (Add No Button), because it is far more beneficial for the user to be able to get rid of the Yes button rather than staring at it until the break is over.
