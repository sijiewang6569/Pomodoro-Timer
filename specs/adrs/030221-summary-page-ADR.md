* Deciders: Dillan Merchant, Baban Hamesalh, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag, Sijie Wang
* Date: March 2nd, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to guarantee safety of information after a session, should users be given a summary page pop-up after they have ended their session?

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Yes, there should be a summary page
* Option 2: No, there should not be a summary page

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Summary Page

* Good, because it guarantees that the user will be able to see details of their completed tasks after a session instead of losing them after they're deleted from the task list
* Bad, because it makes the website a little less minimalistic overall and adds a few extra clicks to the user workflow

### Option 2: No Summary Page

* Good, because it emphasizes minimalism
* Bad, because it removes the opportunity for the user to look at their completed tasks after a session has ended

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 (Summary Page), because it is very beneficial for the user to see details about what they've completed, even at the expense of the simplicity of the user workflow.
