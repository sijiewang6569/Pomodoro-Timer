* Deciders: Dillan Merchant, Baban Hamesalh, Fernando Bracamonte, Sash Gollamudi, Sean Ye, Sharon Lei, Siddharth Nag, Sijie Wang
* Date: March 2nd, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Should the user be allowed to change the lengths of the short and long breaks that they get after the end of each pomodoro?

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Yes, short breaks can be 3-5 minutes and long breaks can be 15-30 minutes
* Option 2: No, short breaks should be 5 minutes and long breaks should be 20 minutes

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Modifiable times

* Good, because it allows the user to have flexibility that fits their own schedule
* Good, because it meets the traditional sense of a pomodoro timer
* Bad, because it creates more options and thereby reduces the minimalism of the site

### Option 2: Fixed times

* Good, because it increases minimalism of the site
* Bad, because it doesn't follow the traditional aspects of a pomodoro timer

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 (Modifiable times), because it is far more important to adhere to traditional aspects of a pomodoro timer than it is to make our site minimalistic
